Fix my EXIF!
===
Sometimes I probably lose control of my keyboard and I mess with the ordering of my Shotwell
pictures library. Old photos are at the top and new contents keep being presented later onâ€¦
This script is an attempt to sort things out in the most elegant manner, using different sources.

# How to use it
```shell
# Fixing May 2023 pictures:
./main.exp ~/Images/Photos/2023/05
```

# Operation
This script considers several source of data on the pictures:
* the UNIX `stat()` file attributes;
* the picture's EXIF data;
* the filename.
